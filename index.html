            <h2>The universe's most honourable, supreme, and finest creature</h2>

            <p>Every individual is capable of reaching the highest level of perfection; they can be vicegerents of
                Allah; they can be the real servants of Allah. These capacities or potentialities, excel in quality
                compared to every other creature. Natural gifts do not make us better than other creatures at
                birth.<br><br><b>“Then we transformed the life-germ into a clot, then the clot into a ball of flesh,
                    then
                    the lump of flesh into bones, finally the bones into flesh, and then we caused it to grow into
                    another creature, so praised be Allah, the greatest of the creators.” [Surah Al-Mu'minun:14]</b>
